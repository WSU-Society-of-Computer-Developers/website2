  <!--
    Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
    It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
    Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

    Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
    work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
    Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
